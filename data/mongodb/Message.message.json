  "content": "If your Whirlpool refrigerator's ice maker is not working, you can try several troubleshooting steps to fix it:\n\nFirst, check the water supply line to ensure it is turned on and not clogged or frozen, as this is essential for ice production. Next, inspect the ice maker's metal shutoff arm to confirm it is in the down position; if it's raised, the ice maker will stop working. You can gently lower the arm to see if the ice maker cycles.\n\nAlso, test the ice maker module or motor for electrical continuity and physical damage, replacing it if faulty. The water inlet valve should be checked for voltage and continuity as well, replacing it if defective. Finally, make sure the freezer temperature is set to 0°F (-18°C) or colder since warmer temperatures can prevent ice production.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you further on any specific step, part testing, or replacement.

  "content": "Here are some troubleshooting steps for your Whirlpool refrigerator ice maker that's not working:\n\n**Start with the basics:** First, make sure the ice maker is turned on - some models have a simple on/off switch or a wire shutoff arm that needs to be in the correct position.\n\n**Check the water supply:** Look for kinks or clogs in the water line that might be preventing water from reaching the ice maker. Also verify that the water valve to your refrigerator is fully open.\n\n**Test the water inlet valve:** This valve controls water flow into the ice maker. You can test it with a multimeter for continuity, and if it's defective, it will need replacement.\n\n**Inspect the ice maker mechanism:** Check for ice jams or blockages in the ice maker mold. Some models have a test button or you can manually initiate a cycle by lifting and lowering the shutoff arm to see if the mechanism cycles properly.\n\n**Temperature check:** The ice maker won't work if your freezer temperature is above about 15°F (-9°C), so make sure your freezer is cold enough for ice production.\n\nWould you like me to help you find specific replacement parts for any of these components, or do you need more detailed instructions for testing a particular part?",
